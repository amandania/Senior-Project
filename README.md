# Senior-Project Project Installation

Both client and server run on Version 2019.4.8f ofthe Unity Engine.
Downloaded the engine: ```https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download```

Download the version package: ```https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.```

Clone the repository or extra the zip file onto your desktop.
```https://github.com/amandania/Senior-Project```

You will notice there is a client folder and a server folder. Both folders are
independent project folders for unity to load. Make sure you have a unity
license which is 100% free.

You must open the Unity dash bash and add the project directory into the
dashboard. You will need to set the unity version here as well. Make sure
you have that downloaded before you add the project to the dashboard.

Click Add and load the server and client individually.

Once you load them make sure you have unity version set to 2018.4.8f
Once this is done you can either run the client from the engine or build an
output version. Which is a launchable version of the client.
Iâ€™ve included a deployable version in the download
